1.USAGE

From the project folder, execute the following commands:

npm install

This will install all required dependencies, including a local version of Webpack that is going to build and bundle the app. There is no need to install Webpack globally.

To run the app execute the following command:

npm start

This command starts the webpack development server that serves the build bundles. You can now browse the skeleton app at http://localhost:9000. Changes in the code will automatically build and reload the app.
